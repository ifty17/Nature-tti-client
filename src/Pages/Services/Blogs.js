            Difference between SQL and NoSQL

            <p>
              SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational
              databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and
              tables with logical links between them). NoSQL is a class of DBMs
              that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL.

            What is JWT, and how does it work?

          <div className="collapse-content">
            <p>
              Basically the identity provider(IdP) generates a JWT certifying
              user identity and Resource server decodes and verifies the
              authenticity of the token using secret salt / public key. JWT User
              sign-in using username and password or google/facebook.
              Authentication server verifies the credentials and issues a jwt
              signed using either a secret salt or a private key. User's Client
              uses the JWT to access protected resources by passing the JWT in
              HTTP Authorization header. Resource server then verifies the
              authenticity of the token using the secret salt/ public key.

            What is the difference between javascript and NodeJS?
          </div>
          <div className="collapse-content">
            <p>
              JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with
              any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node.js, on
              the other hand, is an interpreter or execution environment for the
              JavaScript programming language. It requires libraries that can be
              conveniently accessed from JavaScript programming to be more
              helpful.

            How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?
          </div>
          <div className="collapse-content">
            <p>
              NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into
              EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven
              architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite
              loop that receives requests and processes them.
